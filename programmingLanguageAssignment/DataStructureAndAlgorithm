Data Structure
-vector<String> for storing user items
-vector<vector<String> > for storing csv file menu data(2D matrix)
-vector<pair<string,string> > for storing key value pair of resturant id and min value.



Algorithm

1) Take input from user via command line.If user miss csv file or items then it show error message and exit from program.


	if(argc < 3){	
  		cout<<"Usage: "<<argv[0]<<" <csvfilename> <item> <item> ...\n";
    	exit(0);
   	}



2) then storing items to vector data type itemList

3) Retriveing row by row from csv file and storing id, value and items in a vector and then storing that vector in 2D vector.This will result in 2D vector containing menu of all resturants.


		vector<vector<string> > menuResturant;   

4)Starting loop on 2D array row by row and storing each resturant menu rows in 2D vector and then call a function on that 2D vector of respective resturant.

5)Now in this function, It will find min value price for user items for that resturant and send back result.

6)Now after getting all min value price of each resturant menu for user item List. Sort the value to get min among all and return its value along with resturant id.
